# GDPR Compliance Guide for Ad-Based Web Games

This guide explains how to implement GDPR compliance for your ad-based web game and why it's critical for your business.

## Why GDPR Compliance is Critical

For ad-based games, GDPR compliance is not optional - it's a business necessity:

1. **AdMob Requirement:** Ad networks like AdMob require GDPR compliance
2. **Account Protection:** Non-compliance results in permanent AdMob account banning
3. **Revenue Protection:** Account banning means loss of ALL unpaid earnings
4. **Legal Requirement:** GDPR violations can result in significant fines

## Key GDPR Requirements for Ad-Based Games

### 1. Cookie Consent Banner
Users must be informed about data collection and give explicit consent.

Implementation: [cookie-consent.js](cookie-consent.js) provides a compliant banner that:
- Clearly explains data collection
- Offers granular consent options
- Remembers user preferences
- Allows withdrawal of consent

### 2. Privacy Policy
Users must be informed about what data is collected and how it's used.

Implementation: [privacy-policy.html](privacy-policy.html) explains:
- What data AdMob collects through ads
- How that data is used
- User rights under GDPR
- Contact information for privacy inquiries

### 3. Personalized vs Non-Personalized Ads
Users must be able to choose whether to receive personalized ads.

Implementation: The consent banner offers this choice, and [ads.js](ads.js) respects user preferences.

## Critical Business Advice

### Worst-Case Scenario
Your biggest risk as an ad-only business is **getting banned from your ad network**, not chargebacks (which don't apply to ads).

**Cause:** Invalid click activity including:
- Clicking your own ads (even once to test)
- Incentivizing clicks ("click this ad for a reward")
- Player maliciously spamming clicks

**Result:** Permanent AdMob account disable and loss of ALL unpaid earnings.

### Prevention Measures

1. **Never click your own ads**
   - Use only test ads during development
   - Test ad units are implemented in the code
   - Real ad units should only be used in production

2. **Design to prevent accidental clicks**
   - Ads are clearly distinguishable from game content
   - No ads placed where they can be accidentally clicked
   - Interstitial ads only shown at natural break points

3. **No incentivized clicks**
   - Rewarded video ads are opt-in only
   - No rewards for clicking regular ads
   - Clear distinction between ad types

4. **Follow all policies exactly**
   - Review AdMob policies regularly
   - Ensure ad placement complies with guidelines
   - Monitor account for policy violations

## Action Plan

1. **Build Core Gameplay First**
   - Focus on making the tap-merge loop fun and addictive
   - Gameplay > Monetization in early development

2. **Integrate AdMob Early**
   - Implement AdMob SDK with test ads
   - Plan rewarded video and interstitial placements

3. **Design for Ads**
   - Weave ad opportunities into core progression
   - Make ads feel like helpful bonuses, not interruptions

4. **Implement GDPR Compliance**
   - Already included in this project
   - Test thoroughly before launch

5. **Launch & Test**
   - Release to small audience first
   - Monitor AdMob dashboard for issues
   - Track RPM (Revenue per mille) by placement

6. **Optimize**
   - Double down on high-performing placements
   - Remove or tweak underperforming ads
   - Continuously improve based on data
