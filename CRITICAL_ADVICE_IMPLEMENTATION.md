# Critical Technical & Business Advice Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the implementation of critical technical and business advice for your ad-based web game.

## Platform Choice Implementation

The game is designed for **web deployment** using GitHub Pages:

- More freedom in monetization methods compared to app stores
- No app store billing requirements (ads-only model)
- Requires traffic generation strategy (not implemented in code)
- Must follow AdMob's web policies (implemented through compliance measures)

## Worst-Case Scenario Prevention

### Risk: Ad Network Account Banning

**Cause:** Invalid click activity including:
- Clicking your own ads (even once to test)
- Incentivizing clicks ("click this ad for a reward")
- Player maliciously spamming clicks

**Result:** Permanent AdMob account disable and loss of ALL unpaid earnings.

### Prevention Measures Implemented

1. **Never Click Own Ads**
   - Test ads used during development (hardcoded in ads.js and index.html)
   - Clear warnings in code comments
   - Simulated ads in development mode

2. **Accidental Click Prevention**
   - Ad placement designed to prevent accidental clicks
   - Clear visual distinction between ads and game elements
   - Interstitial ads only shown at natural break points

3. **No Incentivized Clicks**
   - Rewarded video ads are opt-in only
   - No rewards for clicking regular ads
   - Clear distinction between ad types

4. **Policy Compliance**
   - Review AdMob policies regularly (referenced in documentation)
   - Ad placement complies with guidelines
   - Monitoring for policy violations (through analytics)

## GDPR & Privacy Compliance

### Legal Requirements Implemented

1. **Cookie Consent Banner**
   - Implemented in cookie-consent.js
   - Clearly explains data collection
   - Offers granular consent options
   - Remembers user preferences

2. **Privacy Policy**
   - Implemented in privacy-policy.html
   - Explains what data AdMob collects through ads
   - How that data is used
   - User rights under GDPR

3. **Personalized vs Non-Personalized Ads**
   - User choice implemented through consent banner
   - Respected in ads.js
