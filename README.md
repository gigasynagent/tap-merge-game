### Platform Choice
This game is designed for **web deployment** using GitHub Pages:
- More freedom in monetization methods
- No app store billing requirements (ads-only model)
- Requires traffic generation strategy
- Must follow AdMob's web policies

### Worst-Case Scenario Prevention
For ad-only games, the biggest risk is **getting banned from your ad network**:

**NEVER click your own ads!** This results in:
- Permanent AdMob account ban
- Loss of ALL unpaid earnings
- No recovery possible

Prevention measures implemented:
- Test ads used during development
- Ad placement designed to prevent accidental clicks
- No incentivized ad clicks
- Policy compliance monitoring
